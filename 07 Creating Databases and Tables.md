# CREATE

General Syntax:
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column_name TYPE column_constraint,
	column_name TYPE column_constraint,
	column_name TYPE column_constraint,
	table_constraint table_constraint
	) INHERITS existing_table_name;
```

Example:
```
CREATE TABLE players (
	player_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	age SMALLINT NOT NULL
	);
```

## SERIAL

* A sequence is a special kind of database object that generates a sequence of integers
* Often used as the primary key column in a table
* It will create a sequence object and set the next value generated by the sequence as the default value for the column
* Perfect for primary key, because it logs unique integer entries for you automatically upon insertion
* If a row is later removed, the column with the SERIAL data type will not adjust, marking the fact that a row was removed from the sequence.
* Data types include smallserial, serial, and bigserial.
